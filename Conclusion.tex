\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The project presented a detailed analysis of the variable
length pendulum, studying two controllers based on
total and partial energy shaping. After introducing LaSalle's
Invariance Principle and the motion equation of the VLP
with the formulation of the trajectory tracking problem,
the two controllers are presented. It is immediate to notice
how partial energy shaping eliminates the presence of singular
points, making it possible to correctly perform a swing
trajectory. The considered system presents two equilibrium
points, both unstable. Theoretical results are validated with
a Simulink implementation of the controllers, reflecting the
results obtained in \cite{xin2014control}.
